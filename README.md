# Intro to Flexbox

### Why is this important?
*This workshop is important because:*

This will be another tool in your tool belt for front-end techniques. The benefits of using Flexbox is you do not need to cdn or download any third party software to help you make responsive front ends. This tool is light weight, fast, and built into CSS3. 

### Objectives
- Use the flexbox grid system and styling techniques
- Navigate, position, and style different elements using flexbox

### Where we should be now
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*
- Comfortable using bootstap and skeleton's grid system
- Able to create a simple stylesheet

### Tired of using 3rd party grid systems?!
Then use flexbox and CSS3 instead!

### What is Flexbox?
*Definition from MDN:*

"The CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox, is a layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents."
